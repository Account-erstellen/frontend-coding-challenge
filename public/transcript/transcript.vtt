00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.809
Finding a location,

1
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.289
organising booth builders,

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.250
booking hotels and flights,

3
00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:07.530
planning an event is a lot of work.

4
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.329
travelling to event locations,

5
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.319
blocking time for overnight stays.

6
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.739
It is neither sustainable nor cost efficient.

7
00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:16.969
But there is no alternative to successful networking,

8
00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:17.770
is there?

9
00:00:18.379 --> 00:00:19.139
Perhaps not,

10
00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:20.809
as long as it looks like this.

11
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.299
An online event only works if it feels like a real on-site event.

12
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.250
That's why our events look like this,

13
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.450
or this,

14
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.659
or even like this.

15
00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:36.150
We create a true to life event atmosphere set in an engaging environment.

16
00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:38.860
Accessible from anywhere in the world.

17
00:00:39.349 --> 00:00:42.509
The event environment can be 100% custom designed

18
00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:44.900
and is based on your individual needs.

19
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.860
Communicate your brand's message and integrate sponsors into the event.

20
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.470
In the meeting areas,

21
00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:53.580
participants can connect and chat in video calls.

22
00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:57.490
The content of the conversation stays between the participants.

23
00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.909

27
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.199

28
